## Unreleased

**Authoring fixes from the third direct-authoring experiment (cycle 3)**

- Named colors and text styles. The site manifest declares the project's theme (`SiteManifest.theme`: colors,
  text styles, roles, `dark`, and `ThemeTokens.media`, rules that patch the theme by screen size); a color field
  may name one of its colors (`"color": "ember"`, kept through decode and encode as `Color.named`) and a text
  style may start from a named one (`"style": "title"`, or `{"from": "title", ...}`: `TextStyle.from`, merged as
  `TextStyle.merge`). `ThemeTokens.color`, `textStyle` (resolved: `from` chains, colors by name, aliases),
  `atScreen`; `ThemeRefs` / `resolveThemeRefs` resolve a node or a document by its declarations (props,
  decoration, behaviors, media and state patches), leaving the nodes that name nothing the same objects.
  `Color.fromHex` reads values only (the old `fromJson`). A media or state patch that names another style
  replaces the style; one that changes fields merges over the named style. New diagnostics `unknown_theme_name`
  (with the nearest name) and `invalid_theme`; `validateTheme`; `ValidateOptions.theme` (the manifest's by
  default). **Behaviour change (documents that validated stay the same):** a color string that is neither a hex
  color nor anything else (`"blue"`) decoded to null and now decodes as an unresolved theme name (transparent);
  validation reported it before and reports it now.
- `IconProps.size` (Flutter's `Icon.size`).
- A media rule's patch may set `bind` (bindings at its sizes only; `null` drops one of the node's) and `motion`
  (a paint-only transform). `media_overridden` says how to combine a rule and a binding.
- `layout_clamped` points to the overlap patterns (motion translate, a stack).
- Docs: the guide and the starter lead with the theme; overlapping a neighbour, bleeding past the gutter, a
  verified full-width band with capped content and a table from one cell template, form control styling,
  `foregroundFills` over children, a literal `$` before an expression, superscripts, arrow keys through
  `keyDown`, component parameter kinds; the allowed-modes table marks fill with `basis` in a wrapping row;
  `bindings.md` lists what each path expects.

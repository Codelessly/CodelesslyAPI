## Unreleased

**Streaming generative UI, hardened against real model output**

- `OpStreamDecoder` recovers every well-formed op from tool input that is not valid JSON (eager tool input
  streaming does not promise it; a recorded live generation closed one brace too many three times): a repaired copy
  of the text (stray closers dropped, missing ones inferred, trailing commas removed, missing commas inserted), op
  objects read at any depth outside another op, re-synchronisation when an op begins before the previous one
  closed. Each repair is one `malformed_input` warning with the character offset; `OpStreamEnd.repairs` and
  `.recovered`; `StreamedOp.recovered`. A set op's node fields written beside `"node"` move into it
  (`misplaced_field`). Property tests: any chunking yields the same ops; 2,000 single brace, bracket or comma
  edits lose no op but the one they land in; the three recorded live generations decode whole (24, 50, 34 ops).
- The retry protocol: `EditResult.toModelJson()` says what the document holds (ids set, patched, moved, removed;
  roots, node count, pending) and, when anything is rejected or pending, `next` (fix by patching, same ids, never
  start over); `fixInstruction`; `EditResult.withDiagnostics`. `applyOps(protectRoots: true)` answers a batch
  that would replace the roots or add a canvas with `start_over`. `explainDiagnostic` spells out the fix for the
  codes models hit (`unknown_layout_key hug`, `children_not_allowed` and `invalid_parent` with the types that take
  children, a button's `text`, `would_orphan`, `canvas_as_child`); `atOp` moves the op path with the index.
- `uiLints`: `empty_button`, `low_contrast` and, with a `GlyphCoverage`, `missing_glyph` (with the icon to use);
  codes `no_size` for renderers; `fontCodepoints` reads a font's cmap.
- The runtime docs: `runtimeStarter` is the base set a chat card or small screen needs (layout, decoration and text
  essentials; one table of the base node types with what takes children and their key props, the button family and
  the inputs and lists included; state, bindings, reactions; two examples that apply cleanly), generated from the
  declarations; `docsTopic` answers the `ui_docs` tool for any node type, action type, trigger, behavior or
  feature area (the guide's sections, `guide_topics.g.dart` written by the reference generator); `docsIndex` is the
  base's index. `uiTools(catalog, compact: true, docs: true)`: the op envelope strictly plus `ui_docs`; `ui_read`
  takes `types` (`describeTypes`). Generated: `docs/reference/RUNTIME_STARTER.md`, `ui_tools.compact.json`.
- `TrustProfile.agentApps`: `agent` plus the document's sandboxed scripts (capabilities `variables.read`,
  `variables.write`, `clock`; `TrustProfile.scriptCapabilities`). The `scripts` op sets and removes them by name
  (`ScriptsOp`, `invalid_script`), with an inverse for undo.

**Components in published apps, hosted plugins as components (sections and components, phase 2)**

- `PublishModel.components` (`{type: {version, digest, lastUpdated, fonts}}`, `PublishComponentInfo`),
  `PublishLayoutInfo.components` (the closure a layout calls), `PublishComponent` (stored at
  `PublishSource.componentPath`: `publish/{p}/components/{type}`, `{"schema": 2, "id", "version", "digest",
  "document"}`; a document decoded from a store is written back as stored), `PublishBundle.components` and
  `PublishBundle.extra`. `PublishModel.fontsOf` adds the fonts of the components a layout calls. `canonicalJson`:
  what a component's digest (sha256, computed by the publisher) is over.
- Hosted plugins on the components' path: `PluginWidget.definitionJson` and `PluginPackage.definitions` turn a
  plugin node type into a component definition (its catalog declaration as `widget`, its slots as `slot` nodes,
  its events declared, its formula functions as the root's variables). `PublishBundlePlugins`
  (`pluginVersions`, `withPluginVersions`): plugin payloads embedded in a bundle.
- Validation: `repeated_subtree`, a new `Severity.info`: a subtree of three or more nodes written several times
  over, node for node (ids and names aside), with the copies' ids: "consider a component or a list template".
  Only exact repeats; a repeat inside a reported one is not reported again.
- Docs: DESIGN.md §2.1, §4.2, §4.3, §5.4; docs/design/06 and 05 "Done" / "Not done"; the guide's components
  section (published sites, per-instance rules, slots inside lists, plugins as hosted components,
  `--components-all`, `repeated_subtree`).

**Authoring fixes from the third direct-authoring experiment (cycle 3)**

- Named colors and text styles. The site manifest declares the project's theme (`SiteManifest.theme`: colors,
  text styles, roles, `dark`, and `ThemeTokens.media`, rules that patch the theme by screen size); a color field
  may name one of its colors (`"color": "ember"`, kept through decode and encode as `Color.named`) and a text
  style may start from a named one (`"style": "title"`, or `{"from": "title", ...}`: `TextStyle.from`, merged as
  `TextStyle.merge`). `ThemeTokens.color`, `textStyle` (resolved: `from` chains, colors by name, aliases),
  `atScreen`; `ThemeRefs` / `resolveThemeRefs` resolve a node or a document by its declarations (props,
  decoration, behaviors, media and state patches), leaving the nodes that name nothing the same objects.
  `Color.fromHex` reads values only (the old `fromJson`). A media or state patch that names another style
  replaces the style; one that changes fields merges over the named style. New diagnostics `unknown_theme_name`
  (with the nearest name) and `invalid_theme`; `validateTheme`; `ValidateOptions.theme` (the manifest's by
  default). **Behaviour change (documents that validated stay the same):** a color string that is neither a hex
  color nor anything else (`"blue"`) decoded to null and now decodes as an unresolved theme name (transparent);
  validation reported it before and reports it now.
- `IconProps.size` (Flutter's `Icon.size`).
- A media rule's patch may set `bind` (bindings at its sizes only; `null` drops one of the node's) and `motion`
  (a paint-only transform). `media_overridden` says how to combine a rule and a binding.
- `layout_clamped` points to the overlap patterns (motion translate, a stack).
- Docs: the guide and the starter lead with the theme; overlapping a neighbour, bleeding past the gutter, a
  verified full-width band with capped content and a table from one cell template, form control styling,
  `foregroundFills` over children, a literal `$` before an expression, superscripts, arrow keys through
  `keyDown`, component parameter kinds; the allowed-modes table marks fill with `basis` in a wrapping row;
  `bindings.md` lists what each path expects.
